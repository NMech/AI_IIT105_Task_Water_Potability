## Water Potability Classification
Bibary classification problem in which, based on the values of nine different attributes/features, we classify water samples into one of two categories (0-non potable, 1-potable). The following table contains the aforementioned features as well as a basic description for each one of them.

| # | Attribure       |  Description                         |               
|---|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0 | pH              | acid–base balance of $H_{2}O$ [0-14] |
| 1 | Hardness        | Ca & Mg content in $H_{2}O$ [mg/L]   |
| 2 | Solids          | Total dissolved solids (TDS) [ppm]   |
| 3 | Chloramines     | Total dissolved $NH_{2}Cl$ [ppm]     |
| 4 | Sulfate         | $SO_{4}^{2-}$ content in $H_{2}O$ [mg/L] |
| 5 | Conductivity    | Electrical Conductivity of  $H_{2}O$ [μS/cm] |
| 6 | Organic_Carbon  | Concentration of Organic Carbon [ppm] |
| 7 | Trihalomethanes | Chemicals found in water treated with chlorine [μg/L] |
| 8 | Turbidity       | Light emitting property of water [NTU] |
